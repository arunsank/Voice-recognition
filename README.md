# Voice-recognition
## Description:
This is a simple Voice recognition project using the pannous voice dataset and pannous speech data processing module to detect numbers. This project was completed using tflearn's Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Since this is speech data which has speech signals different number of LSTM layers and timesteps were tried and tested to arrive at an optimum result.
